## What is Bubble?

Bubble is a swiss-tournament generator. It features a top-cut single elimination bracket, ideal for running tournaments for the Pokemon TCG.

## Can I use this to run a sanctioned tournament?

Do not use Bubble for any sanctioned tournaments. For sanctioned tournaments, use the official [Pokemon Event Manager](https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/the-new-pokemon-event-manager-has-arrived).

## Who's in charge of this thing?

Bubble is developed and maintained by Jared Grimes. You can contact him through Twitter [@jaredgrimesey](https://twitter.com/jaredgrimesey) for any questions/comments/concerns.
